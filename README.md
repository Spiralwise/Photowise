# Photowise
A light-weight image viewer and editor using __OpenCV 3.x__ and __Qt__. It is a personnal project in order to improve my skill in computer vision.

For now, you can display your favorite PNG and JPEG file, apply grayscale filter, gaussian filter or reduce color space.

## Installation
Once you clone this repository, you will have to compile [OpenCV 3.x sources](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

Update __.pro__ file by changing path to your openCV binaries and includes.
